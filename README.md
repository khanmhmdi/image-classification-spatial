# Wise-SrNet: A Novel Architecture for Enhancing Image Classification by Learning Spatial Resolution of Feature Maps

**Source paper:** [10.13140/RG.2.2.11271.93606/2](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.11271.93606/2)

The paper aims to fix the spatial resolution loss problem caused by Global Average Pooling layers. The final introduced architecture is called Wise-SrNet, which enables the model to create the classification array from the feature map without losing data and also keeping almost the same computational cost.
